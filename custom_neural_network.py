#Code Idea: Implement a custom neural network architecture that extends TensorFlow's existing neural network capabilities. You can define a new class that inherits from tf.keras.Model and build your own layers, activation functions, and training procedures. This could be a unique architecture designed for specific use cases or a variation of an existing architecture with additional functionalities.

#Your code could include methods for model construction, forward propagation, loss calculation, and training loops. You can also provide example code or instructions on how to use your custom neural network for various tasks like image classification, sentiment analysis, or object detection.

#Remember to follow the project's code style guidelines and document your code with comments and docstrings to make it more understandable and maintainable. This contribution can add value by providing developers with a new neural network architecture that expands the possibilities of TensorFlow and offers more flexibility and customization options for their machine learning projects.


import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class CustomNeuralNetwork(keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CustomNeuralNetwork, self).__init__()
        # Define your custom layers here
        self.flatten = keras.layers.Flatten()
        self.dense1 = keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.flatten(inputs)
        x = self.dense1(x)
        x = self.dense2(x)
        return x

# Example usage
# Instantiate the custom neural network model
model = CustomNeuralNetwork()

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))

# Make predictions using the model
predictions = model.predict(test_images)


#In this code, we define a CustomNeuralNetwork class that extends tf.keras.Model and includes custom layers (flatten, dense1, and dense2). The call method defines the forward pass of the network.

#To use this custom neural network, you can instantiate the model, compile it with an optimizer and loss function, and then train it using your own dataset. Finally, you can make predictions using the trained model.

#Remember to adapt the code to your specific requirements and data. Additionally, you may need to import other necessary libraries and preprocess your data before training the model.
